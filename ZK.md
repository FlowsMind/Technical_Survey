# [ zero-knowledge proof ]

01. gnark (https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark)

`gnark` is a framework to execute (and verify) algorithms in zero-knowledge. It offers a high-level API to easily design circuits and fast implementation of state of the art ZKP schemes. 
`gnark` has not been audited and is provided as-is, use at your own risk. In particular, `gnark` makes no security guarantees such as constant time implementation or side-channel attack resistance.
