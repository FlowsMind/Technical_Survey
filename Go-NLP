https://github.com/james-bowman/nlp

Implementations of selected machine learning algorithms for natural language processing in golang. 
The primary focus for the package is the statistical semantics of plain-text documents supporting semantic analysis and retrieval of semantically similar documents.

Built upon the Gonum[http://www.gonum.org] package for linear algebra and scientific computing with some inspiration taken from Python's scikit-learn and Gensim.
