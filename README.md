### Classification, Decision Trees in Go
1. Hector https://github.com/xlvector/hector - Golang machine learning lib. Currently, it can be used to solve binary classification problems.Logistic Regression , Factorized Machine , CART, Random Forest, Random Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree & Neural Network

2. Decision Trees in Go - https://github.com/ajtulloch/decisiontrees - Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, etc. implemented in Go

3. CloudForest - https://github.com/ryanbressler/CloudForest - Fast, flexible, multi-threaded ensembles of decision trees for machine learning in pure Go (golang).
CloudForest allows for a number of related algorithms for classification, regression, feature selection and structure analysis on heterogeneous numerical / categorical data with missing values.
