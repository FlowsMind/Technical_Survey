https://github.com/olivia-ai/olivia

Olivia is an open-source chatbot built in Golang using Machine Learning technologies. Its goal is to provide a free and open-source alternative to big services like DialogFlow.
You can chat with her by speaking (STT) or writing, she replies with a text message but you can enable her voice (TTS).

2. Gorgonia is a library that helps facilitate machine learning in Go.
Gorgonia is a library that helps facilitate machine learning in Go. 
Write and evaluate mathematical equations involving multidimensional arrays easily. 
If this sounds like Theano or TensorFlow, it's because the idea is quite similar. 
Specifically, the library is pretty low-level, like Theano, but has higher goals like Tensorflow.

3. tensor
https://github.com/gorgonia/tensor

Package tensor is a package that provides efficient, generic (by some definitions of generic) n-dimensional arrays in Go. 
Also in this package are functions and methods that are used commonly in arithmetic, comparison and linear algebra operations.

The main purpose of this package is to support the operations required by Gorgonia.

4. A High-level Machine Learning Library for Go
https://github.com/aunum/goro

Goro is a high-level machine learning library for Go built on Gorgonia. It aims to have the same feel as Keras.
